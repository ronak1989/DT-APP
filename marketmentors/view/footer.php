		<h4>-  Taking a step back</h4>
		<h5><strong><em>"An investment in knowledge pays the best interest."</em></strong> ~ <strong>Benjamin Franklin</strong></h5>
		<p>With a population of over 1.21 billion, India has only 2% of its people investing in the stock market. This clearly indicates the lack of investor education in our country. The need of the hour is to make the masses aware that investing their hard earned money in schemes with good returns is not rocket science. With this thought, Kerala-based entrepreneur Praveen Pathiyil founded Dalal Times in August 2014.</p>
		<p>Engaging and educating our audience to help them understand and appreciate the stock market as a viable investment option is our top priority. All Dalal Times products and services are in line to this philosophy. Apart from the traditional mediums, we have also attuned our product-line by adapting to newer technologies and changing trends. Covering all possible mediums to engage our audience, we at Dalal Times have created platforms to help investors decipher the best channel which can fetch them maximum returns, taking in to account the inflation levels.</p>
		<h4><em>- Where we stand</em></h4>
		<p>Dalal Times is rapidly emerging as an innovative media firm with a product-line that not only focuses on the financial side of the Indian stock market but also takes in to account the business elements that impact fluctuations of the market. Our benchmark coverage extends from corporate news, financial markets coverage, expert perspective on investing and management to industry verticals and beyond. For us, business means quality and we deliver it in the form of knowledge products and services.</p>

		<h4><em>- Outlook</em></h4>
		<p>We at Dalal Times believe in educative approach to fulfil our vision of creating a breed of informed and independent investors. The right approach of researching and analysing the indexes of the Indian Stock Market and initiating a positive outlook towards investing in equities are the ground rules on which our team functions, irrespective of the departments.</p>
		<p>Our aim is to also attract newer segments of the society to the world of equities by reducing the risk quotient with the help of our research expertise. As we conquer domestic market, we intent to reach out to the international audience in the coming time. Going by the present response we have received in a short span of time and increased levels of awareness, we are indeed living our tagline ‘We Define Markets’.</p>

		<h4><em> - Management</em></h4>
		<p><strong>Praveen Pathiyil, Founder</strong><p>
		<p>With stock market experience of over a decade and educational background in finance, his intrinsic research and analytical skills made him start forecasting the market and making money from the trends. On the managerial front, planning and strategizing activities aimed at achieving certain required standards for financial and trading performance, stands to be his forte.</p>
		<p><em>“A good analyst never tries to find the peak or the trough of the markets but rides over the market trends.”</em></p>

		<p><strong>Sajid Ahamed, Founder</strong><p>
		<p>After a post graduate degree in Business Administration, he started off his career with insurance sales. However, soon realised that his calling was for the capital market. Passion turned in to profession and ever since, stock markets know him as an investor, trader and broker. His understanding of the business and portfolio management skills are a definite advantage to the firm.</p>

		<p><strong>Nameeta Shinghwani, CEO</strong><p>
		<p>Her compelling approach to business and execution abilities are courtesy her Master’s degree in Marketing, followed by years of relevant experience in various media houses. Her core competencies lie in leveraging new market opportunities to grow Dalal Times’s operations. The responsibilities of expansion and global operations also stand on her shoulders.</p>
		<p><em>“Unveiling the best kept secrets of the stock market, be it on the Technical or Fundamental front is how Dalal Times will march ahead of its competitors.”</em></p>
